# SQL-for-data-analysis

In this project, I designed and implemented a comprehensive relational database to manage library operations efficiently. From creating normalized tables for branches, employees, books, members, and transactions, to handling day-to-day tasks like book issuance, returns, member registrations, and more—this project covers all foundational aspects of library data management.

What I Did:
Built a robust database schema featuring tables for branches, books, members, employees, book issues, and returns.
Populated realistic sample data for all tables to simulate actual library operations.
Developed and executed complex SQL queries for CRUD operations—adding new books, updating member details, deleting records, and more.
Generated actionable reports such as:
Employee performance (books issued per employee)
Most rented books and popular categories (using aggregations and joins)
Lists of recent members
Books not yet returned
High-value rentals (books above a certain price)


Tools & Skills Used:
SQL (DDL & DML commands, joins, aggregation, CTAS)
Relational database design and normalization
Data cleansing, scenario-based data simulation, and advanced reporting
